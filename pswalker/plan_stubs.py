    """
    Plan to prepare image motors for taking data. Moves the correct imagers in

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_mot: int
        Index of the motor in img_motors that we need to take data with.

    img_motors: list of OphydObject
        OphydObjects to move in or out. These objects need to have .set methods
        that accept the strings "IN" and "OUT", reacting appropriately, and
        need to accept a "timeout" kwarg that allows their status to be set as
        done after a timeout. These should be ordered by increasing distance
        to the source.

    prev_out: bool, optional
        If True, pull out imagers closer to the source than the one we need to
        use. Default True. (True if imager blocks beam)

    tail_in: bool, optional
        If True, put in imagers after this one, to be ready for later. If
        False, don't touch them. We won't wait for the tail motors to move in.

    timeout: number, optional
        Only wait for this many seconds before moving on.

    -------
    ok: bool
        True if the wait succeeded, False otherwise.
