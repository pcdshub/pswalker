    Step a motor until a specific threshold is reached on the detector

    This function assumes a linear relationship between the position of the
    given motor and the position on the YAG. While at the onset of the plan, we
    don't know anything about the physical setup of the system, we can track
    the steps as they happen and use our prior attempts to inform future ones.

    The first step of the plan makes a move out into the unknown parameter
    space of the model. Using the two data points of the initial centroid and
    the result of our first step we can form a coarse model by simply drawing a
    line through each point. A new step is calculated based on this rudimentary
    model, and the centroid is measured again now at a third point. As we
    gather more data points on successive attempts at alignment our linear fit
    improves. The iteration stops when the algorithm has centered the beam
    within the specified tolerance.

    There are ways to seed the walk with the known information to make the
    first step the algorithm takes more fruitful. The most naive is to give it
    a logical first step size that will keep the object you are trying to
    center within the image. However, in some cases we may know enough to have
    a reasonable first guess at the relationship between pitch and centroid. In
    this case the algorithm accepts the :param:`.gradient` parameter that is
    then used to calculate the optimal first step. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    detector : :class:`.BeamDetector`
        YAG to make measure beam centroid

    first_step : float, optional

    gradient : float, optional
        Assume an initial gradient for the relationship between pitch and beam
        center

    target_fields : iterable, optional
        (detector, motor) fields to average and calculate line of best fit

    models : list, optional
        Additional models to include in the :func:`.fitwalk`

    system : list, optional
        Extra detectors to include in the datastream as we measure the average

    tolerance : int, optional
        Number of pixels the final centroid position is allowed to differ from
        the target
